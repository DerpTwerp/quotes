    &quot;You're as good as the chances you take.&quot;<br>
    - Al Pacino<br>
    <br>
    &quot;When you are facing in the wrong direction, progress means walking 
    backwards.&quot; - Nigel Goldenfeld<br>
    <br>
    &quot;First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do.&quot;<br>
    - Epictetus<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Asking for help doesn’t mean that we are weak or incompetent. It usually 
    indicates an advanced level of honesty and intelligence.&quot;<br>
    - Anne Wilson Schaef<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The healthy, the strong individual, is the one who asks for help when he 
    needs it. Whether he has an abscess on his knee or in his soul.&quot;<br>
    - Rona Barrett<br>
    <br>
    In the Delfin Knowledge System, Leslie Fieger advises, &quot;You can have more 
    when you are willing to give more. You must begin this process by giving 
    more to yourself. Give yourself more time; give yourself more attention; 
    give yourself more love; give yourself more of what you want. Then decide 
    how to offer the more that you are (and have) to the world and you will 
    receive even more back in return.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Let the waters settle<br>
    you will see stars and moon <br>
    mirrored in your Being.&quot;<br>
    - Rumi<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Reflection is one of the most underused yet powerful tools for success.&quot;<br>
    - Richard Carlson<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Follow effective action with quiet reflection. From the quiet reflection 
    will come even more effective action.&quot;<br>
    - James Levin<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The universe is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to 
    grow sharper.&quot;<br>
    - Eden Phillpotts<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The greatest discovery of my generation is that a human being can alter his 
    life by altering his attitudes.&quot;<br>
    - William James<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.&quot;<br>
    - Lewis Carroll<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You may be good, but what are you good for? You’ve got to be good for 
    something. You’ve got to be about some project, some task that requires you 
    to be humble and obedient to the universal principles of service.&quot;<br>
    - Stephen R. Covey<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We had to learn ourselves, and furthermore we had to teach the despairing 
    men, that it did not matter what we expected from life, but rather what life 
    expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life but 
    instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life, 
    daily and hourly. Our answer must consist not in talk and meditation, but in 
    right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the 
    responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the 
    tasks which it constantly sets for the individual.&quot;<br>
    - Victor Frankl<br>
    <br>
    &quot;If you think you're too small to have an impact, try going to bed with a 
    mosquito in the room.&quot;<br>
    - Anita Roddick<br>
    <br>
    Vladimir Nabokov once dismissed as “preposterous” the French writer Alain 
    Robbe-Grillet’s assertions that his novels eliminated psychology: “The 
    shifts of levels, the interpenetration of successive impressions and so 
    forth belong of course to psychology,” Nabokov said, “—psychology at its 
    best.” Later asked, “Are you a psychological novelist?” Nabokov replied: 
    “All novelists of any worth are psychological novelists.”<br>
    <br>
    “Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back. 
    Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary 
    truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that 
    the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too. All 
    sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. 
    A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor 
    all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, 
    which no man could have dreamed would have come his way. Whatever you can 
    do, or dream you can do, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in 
    it. Begin it now.”<br>
    - Goethe<br>
    <br>
    &quot;When humans find themselves surrounded by nothing but objects, the response 
    is always one of loneliness.&quot;<br>
    - Brian Swimme<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Thinking about interior peace destroys interior peace. The patient who 
    constantly feels his pulse is not getting any better.&quot;<br>
    - Hubert van Zeller<br>
    <br>
    &quot;So many people work so hard, to achieve, attain, accumulate and cherish 
    their fortunes. How many of us blissfully fill our days and nights being the 
    Divine expression we are? This is the meaning of life. It is to be. As a 
    result, all of your creations are a natural outflow from the Divine within 
    your being. This is the joy of life.&quot;<br>
    - Barbara Rose<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Money cannot fill an empty soul.&quot;<br>
    - Julia Cameron &amp; Mark Bryan<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Both abundance and lack exist simultaneously in our lives, as parallel 
    realities. It is always our conscious choice which secret garden we will 
    tend... when we choose not to focus on what is missing from our lives but 
    are grateful for the abundance that’s present - love, health, family, 
    friends, work, the joys of nature and personal pursuits that bring us 
    pleasure - the wasteland of illusion falls away and we experience Heaven on 
    earth.&quot;<br>
    - Sarah Ban Breathnach<br>
    <br>
    &quot;More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones.&quot;<br>
    - Mother Teresa<br>
    <br>
    &quot;God answers prayer in His own way, not ours.&quot;<br>
    - Mohandas Gandhi<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Generosity lies less in giving much than in giving at the right moment.&quot;<br>
    - Jean De La Bruyère<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Generosity is another quality which, like patience, letting go, 
    non-judging, and trust, provides a solid foundation for mindfulness 
    practice. You might experiment with using the cultivation of generosity as a 
    vehicle for deep self-observation and inquiry as well as an exercise in 
    giving.&quot;<br>
    - Jon Kabat Zinn<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Work is not always required ... there is such a thing as sacred idleness, 
    the cultivation of which is now fearfully neglected.&quot;<br>
    - George MacDonald<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Rest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass on a summer day 
    listening to the murmur of water, or watching the clouds float across the 
    sky, is hardly a waste of time.&quot;<br>
    - Sir J. Lubbock<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Paying off your debts and saving money is less stressful than spending the 
    rest of your life with your back against a financial wall.&quot;<br>
    - Ron Hiebert<br>
    <br>
    &quot;True financial freedom is not only having money, but having power over that 
    money as well.&quot;<br>
    - Suze Orman<br>
    <br>
    &quot;People are lonely because they build walls instead of bridges.&quot;<br>
    - Joseph F. Newton<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We have to decide for ourselves what’s nourishing to our souls, and do 
    those things over others.&quot;<br>
    - Thomas Moore<br>
    <br>
    &quot;He who has achieved success has worked well, laughed often and loved much.&quot;<br>
    - Elbert Hubbard<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Too often, people focus only on results. But getting results without 
    learning something or without having fun are incomplete. So is having fun 
    without getting the results, or having fun without learning something new to 
    help and empower you in the future. Accomplishment is all three: the result, 
    personal growth and having fun.&quot;<br>
    - Peter L. Hirsch<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There are many aspects to success; material wealth is only one component. 
    ...But success also includes good health, energy and enthusiasm for life, 
    fulfilling relationships, creative freedom, emotional and psychological 
    stability, a sense of well-being, and peace of mind.&quot;<br>
    - Deepak Chopra<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You don’t have to stay up nights to succeed; you have to stay awake days.&quot;<br>
    - Source Unknown<br>
    <br>
    &quot;More than any other part of the body, our hands reveal our inner state.&quot;<br>
    - Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Man’s loneliness is but his fear of life.&quot;<br>
    - Eugene O'Neill<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Anything in any way beautiful derives its beauty from itself and asks for 
    nothing beyond itself. Praise is no part of it, for nothing is made worse or 
    better by praise.&quot; - Marcus Aurelius <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &quot;What is always speaking silently is the body.&quot;<br>
    - Norman Brown<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It's surprising how many persons go through life without ever recognizing 
    that their feelings toward other people are largely determined by their 
    feelings toward themselves, and if you're not comfortable within yourself, 
    you can't be comfortable with others.&quot;<br>
    - Sydney J. Harris<br>
    <br>
    &quot;In times of change learners inherit the earth; while the learned find 
    themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists.&quot; 
    -Eric Hoffer <br>
    <br>
    “The great thing in the world is not so much where we stand, as in what 
    direction we are moving.” – Oliver Wendell Holmes<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The central event of the twentieth century is the overthrow of matter. 
    ...The powers of the mind are everywhere ascendant over the brute force of 
    things.&quot;<br>
    - George Gilder<br>
    <br>
    &quot;If each of us sweeps in front of our own steps, the whole world would be 
    clean.&quot;<br>
    - Goethe<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The purpose of relationships is not happiness, but transformation.&quot;<br>
    - Andrew Schneider<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Poverty is in separatism. Abundance is in unity.&quot;<br>
    - Torkom Saraydarian<br>
    <br>
    &quot;...conflict is the primary engine of creativity and innovation. People 
    don't learn by staring into a mirror; people learn by encountering 
    difference.&quot;<br>
    - Ronald Heifetz<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Homogeneity makes for healthy milk but anemic friendships. We need 
    relationships that cross culturally imposed lines to enlarge our hearts and 
    expand our vistas.&quot;<br>
    - Dan Schmidt<br>
    <br>
    Neale Donald Walsch’s words: &quot;there’s only one of us in this room.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &quot;If we are to achieve a rich culture, rich in contrasting values, we must 
    recognize the whole gamut of human potentialities, and so weave a less 
    arbitrary social fabric, one in which each diverse human gift will find a 
    fitting place.&quot;<br>
    - Margaret Mead<br>
    <br>
    &quot;When the sun rises, I go to work. When the sun goes down, I take my rest. I 
    dig the well from which I drink. I farm the soil which yields my food. I 
    share creation. Kings can do no more.&quot;<br>
    - Chinese proverb<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I think the reward for conformity is that everyone likes you except 
    yourself.&quot;<br>
    - Rita Mae Brown<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Once in a while it really hits people that they don’t have to experience 
    the world in the way they have been told to.&quot;<br>
    - Alan Keightley<br>
    <br>
    &quot;If we have not quiet in our minds, outward comfort will do no more for us 
    than a golden slipper on a gouty foot.&quot;<br>
    - John Bunyan<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Try to be like the turtle - at ease in your own shell.&quot;<br>
    - Bill Copeland<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Anger is that powerful internal force that blows out the light of reason.&quot;<br>
    - Ralph Waldo Emerson<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Once, when we were discussing a world peace project with my teacher, 
    Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, somebody asked him, ‘Where is all the money going to 
    come from?’ And he replied without hesitation, ‘From wherever it is at the 
    moment.’&quot;<br>
    - Deepak Chopra<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Manifestation is an act of trust. It is the soul pouring itself out into 
    its world, like a fisherman casting a net to gather in the fish he seeks; 
    with each cast properly made, we will bring what we need to us, but first we 
    must hurl ourselves into the depths without knowing just what lies beneath 
    us.&quot;<br>
    - David Spangler<br>
    <br>
    &quot;At the core of all anger is a need that is not being fulfilled.&quot;<br>
    - Marshall B. Rosenberg<br>
    <br>
    &quot;How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of 
    it.&quot;<br>
    - Marcus Aurelius<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Few people have any next, they live from hand to mouth without a plan, and 
    are always at the end of their line.&quot;<br>
    - Ralph Waldo Emerson<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Organizing is what you do before you do something, so that when you do it, 
    it is not all mixed up.&quot;<br>
    - A. A. Milne<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Always have a plan, and believe in it. Nothing happens by accident.&quot;<br>
    - Chuck Knox<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Our deepest need is for the joy that comes with loving and being loved, 
    with knowing we are of genuine use to others.&quot;<br>
    - Eknath Easwaran<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We are able to be of service to those who suffer only to the extent that we 
    have been able to transform fear in our own lives.&quot;<br>
    - Robert Sardello<br>
    <br>
    &quot;God has no other hands than ours.&quot;<br>
    - Dorothee Solle<br>
    <br>
    &quot;One act of beneficence, one act of real usefulness, is worth all the 
    abstract sentiment in the world.&quot;<br>
    - Ann Radcliffe<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Past the seeker as he prayed came the crippled and the beggar and the 
    beaten. And seeing them... he cried, ‘Great God, how is it that a loving 
    creator can see such things and yet do nothing about them?’... God said, ‘I 
    did do something. I made you.’&quot;<br>
    - Sufi Teaching<br>
    <br>
    &quot;To learn to get along without, to realize that what the world is going to 
    demand of us may be a good deal more important than what we are entitled to 
    demand of it - this is a hard lesson.&quot;<br>
    - Bruce Catton<br>
    <br>
    &quot;If doubt is challenging you and you do not act, doubts will grow. Challenge 
    the doubts with action and you will grow. Doubt and action are 
    incompatible.&quot;<br>
    - John Kanary<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Never forget that life can only be nobly inspired and rightly lived if you 
    take it bravely and gallantly, as a splendid adventure in which you are 
    setting out into an unknown country, to meet many a joy, to find many a 
    comrade, to win and lose many a battle.&quot;<br>
    - Annie Besant<br>
    <br>
    &quot;When guilt rears its ugly head confront it, discuss it and let it go. The 
    past is over. It is time to ask what can we do right, not what did we do 
    wrong. Forgive yourself and move on.&quot;<br>
    -Bernie S. Siegel<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I have made it a rule of my life never to regret and never to look back. 
    Regret is an appalling waste of energy . . . you can’t build on it; it’s 
    only good for wallowing in.&quot;<br>
    - Katherine Mansfield<br>
    <br>
    &quot;If we don't forgive ourselves for our mistakes, and others for the wounds 
    they have inflicted upon us, we end up crippled with guilt. And the soul 
    cannot grow under a blanket of guilt, because guilt is isolating, while 
    growth is a gradual process of reconnection to ourselves, to other people, 
    and to a larger whole.&quot;<br>
    - Joan Borysenko<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Light burdens borne far become heavy.&quot;<br>
    - French proverb<br>
    <br>
    &quot;To know how to choose a path with heart is to learn how to follow intuitive 
    feeling.&quot;<br>
    - Jean Shinoda Bolen<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There is only one thing more powerful than all the armies of the world, 
    that is an idea whose time has come.&quot;<br>
    - Victor Hugo<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We lie in the lap of immense intelligence.&quot;<br>
    - Ralph Waldo Emerson<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Consciousness is the basis of all life and the field of all possibilities. 
    Its nature is to expand and unfold its full potential. The impulse to evolve 
    is thus inherent in the very nature of life.&quot;<br>
    - Maharishi Mahesh Yogi<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Get your ideas on paper and study them. Do not let them go to waste!&quot;<br>
    - Les Brown<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The thing that I should wish to obtain from money would be leisure with 
    security.&quot; -Bertrand Russell<br>
    <br>
    &quot;In the absense of clearly defined goals, man looks for distractions.&quot;<br>
    - Erick Kristian<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What is it that makes all of us end each day with the sense that we have 
    not lived our time, but have been lived, used by what we do?&quot;<br>
    - Jacob Needleman<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Why has time disappeared in our culture? How is it that after decades of 
    inventions and new technologies devoted to saving time and labor, the result 
    is that there is no time left? We are a time-poor society; we are temporally 
    impoverished. And there is no issue, no aspect of human life, that exceeds 
    this in importance. The destruction of time is literally the destruction of 
    life.&quot;<br>
    - Jacob Needleman<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There are two kinds of men who never amount to much: those who cannot do 
    what they are told, and those who can do nothing else.&quot;<br>
    - Cyrus H. Curtis<br>

    &quot;Compassion, caring, teaching, loving, and sharing your gifts, talents, and 
    abilities are the gateways to power.&quot;<br>

    &quot;My days of whining and complaining about others have come to an end. 
    Nothing is easier than fault finding.&quot;<br>

    &quot;Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or 
    registering wrong.&quot;<br>
    - Charlotte Bronte<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The world is not to be put in order; the world is order, incarnate. It is 
    for us to harmonize with this order.&quot;<br>
    - Henry Miller<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It is not action or effort that we must surrender; it is self-will, and 
    this is terribly difficult. You must do your best constantly, yet never 
    allow yourself to become involved in whether things work out the way you 
    want.&quot;<br>
    - Eknath Easwaran<br>
    <br>
    &quot;True spiritual surrender responsibly opens itself to the unknown.&quot;<br>
    - Stephen V. Doughty<br>

    &quot;The function of prayer is not to influence God, but rather to change the 
    nature of the one who prays.&quot;<br>
    - Soren Kierkegaard<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Spirituality is the sacred center out of which all life comes, including 
    Mondays and Tuesdays and rainy Saturday afternoons in all their mundane and 
    glorious detail. ... The spiritual journey is the soul's life commingling 
    with ordinary life.&quot;<br>
    - Christina Baldwin<br>
    <br>
    &quot;It is not my business to think about myself. My business is to think about 
    God. It is for God to think about me.&quot;<br>
    - Simone Weil<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Joy is prayer - Joy is strength - Joy is love - Joy is a net of love by 
    which you can catch souls. She gives most who gives with Joy.&quot;<br>
    - Mother Teresa<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Never miss a joy in this world of trouble ... that’s my theory!... 
    Happiness, like mercy, is twice blest: it blesses those most intimately 
    associated with it and it blesses all those who see it, hear it, touch it or 
    breathe the same atmosphere.&quot;<br>
    - Kate Douglas Wiggin<br>
    <br>
    &quot;There are three kinds of violence: one, through our deeds; two, through our 
    words; and three, through our thoughts. ... The root of all violence is in 
    the world of thoughts, and that is why training the mind is so important.&quot;<br>
    - Eknath Easwaran<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The ancestor of every destructive action, every destructive decision, is a 
    negative thought.&quot;<br>
    - Eknath Easwaran<br>

    &quot;We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think.

    &quot;It is our basic right to be a happy person, happy family, and eventually a 
    happy world. That should be our goal.&quot;<br>
    - Dalai Lama<br>
    <br>
    &quot; ... we can no longer afford to throw away even one ‘unimportant’ day by 
    not noticing the wonder of it all. We have to be willing to discover and 
    then appreciate the authentic moments of happiness available to all of us 
    every day.&quot;<br>
    - Sarah Ban Breathnach<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I’d gone through life believing in the strength and competence of others; 
    never in my own. Now, dazzled, I discovered that my capacities were real. It 
    was like finding a fortune in the lining of an old coat.&quot;<br>
    - Joan Mills<br>
    <br>
    &quot;People become really quite remarkable when they start thinking that they

    &quot;We cannot rise higher than our thought of ourselves.&quot;<br>

    &quot;Peace comes not from the absence of conflict, but from the ability to cope 
    with it.&quot;<br>
    - Unknown Source<br>

    &quot;Peace is not won by those who fiercely guard their differences, but by 
    those who with open minds and hearts seek out connections.&quot;<br>
    - Katherine Paterson<br>
    <br>
    It is important not to ‘need’ what you are calling to you but rather to have 
    a certain detachment about it. Let it be all right if it doesn’t come, or if 
    it comes in a different form than what you expect. After you have asked for 
    something, surrender to whatever comes as being appropriate.&quot;<br>
    - Sanaya Roman and Duane Packer<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Acceptance says, True, this is my situation at the moment. I’ll look 
    unblinkingly at the reality of it. But I’ll also open my hands to accept 
    willingly whatever a loving Father sends me.&quot;<br>
    -Catherine Marshall<br>
    <br>
    &quot;This business of hozho. The way I understand it ... I’ll use an example. 
    Terrible drought, crops dead, sheep dying. Spring dried out. No water. The 
    Hopi, or the Christian, maybe the Moslem, they pray for rain. The Navajo has 
    the proper ceremony done to restore himself to harmony with the drought. You 
    see what I mean. The system is designed to recognize what’s beyond human 
    power to change, and then to change the human’s attitude to be content with 
    the inevitable.&quot;<br>

    &quot;The very least you can do in your life is to figure out what you hope for. 
    And the most you can do is live inside that hope. Not admire it from a 
    distance but live right in it, under its roof.&quot;<br>

    “For all my good intentions, there are days when things go wrong or I fall 
    into old habits. When things are not going well, when I'm grumpy or mad, 
    I'll realize that I've not been paying attention to my soul and I've not 
    been following my best routine.”<br>

    &quot;... for magic to happen in your life, you must believe in magic.&quot;<br>
    - Grandmother, quoted by Lynn Andrews<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Most of the time, we fall in love but can’t remain there. The world then 
    calls the state we were in a delusion or infatuation ... But we merely 
    lacked, or someone else lacked, the emotional skills to hold on to the magic 
    when the morning came. ... In truth, we can go to the moon and retain its 
    magic for a lifetime.&quot;<br>

    - Greg Anderson<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Every choice moves us closer to or farther away from something. Where are 
    your choices taking your life? What do your behaviors demonstrate that you 
    are saying yes or no to in life?&quot;<br>
    - Eric Allenbaugh<br>
    <br>
    &quot;We think, sometimes, there’s not a dragon left. Not one brave knight, not a 
    single princess gliding through secret forests ... What a pleasure to be 
    wrong. Princesses, knights, enchantments and dragons, mystery and adventure 
    ... not only are they here-and-now, they’re all that ever lived on earth! 
    Masters of reality still meet us in dreams to tell us that we’ve never lost 
    the shield we need against dragons, that blue-fire voltage arcs through us 
    now to change our world as we wish. Intuition whispers true: We’re not dust, 
    we’re magic!&quot;<br>

    &quot;We look at the dance to impart the sensation of living in an affirmation of

    &quot;If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear ... as it 
    is, infinite.&quot;<br>
    - William Blake<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You watch your mind to see who you are not. I watch my mind to gain a sense 
    of its content, which has always been my pain. As I watch it, I get a sense 
    of its impermanence. Thoughts come and go as part of a process. I see how 
    content dissolves into process and begin to see the patterns in the process. 
    Realizing it isn’t MY suffering, MY pain, it becomes THE pain. I’ve gone 
    from the tiny, the small, and the individual to the universal. I feel OUR 
    pain. When we do, we go from fear to compassion. Fear is MY pain, compassion 
    is THE pain.&quot;<br>

    <br>
    Ernest Hemingway once said writing was like bleeding, which means that it 
    either comes naturally or painfully<br>

    &quot;We must let ourselves feel all the painful destruction we want to forgive

    forgive it.&quot;<br>

    - Nathaniel Hawthorne<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You cannot fake a relationship and feel right with yourself or anyone else. 
    Changing yourself to fit what you think other people want doesn’t work. 
    Pretending to be someone other than yourself only broadens the distance 
    between the person you are and the one with whom you’re trying to establish 
    closeness.&quot;<br>

    <br>
    &quot;Meditation may require a lifetime to master, but it will have been a 
    lifetime well spent. ... If you want to judge your progress, ask yourself 
    these questions: Am I more loving? Is my judgment sounder? Do I have more 
    energy? Can my mind remain calm under provocation? Am I free from the 
    conditioning of anger, fear, and greed? Spiritual awareness reveals itself 
    as eloquently in character development and selfless action as in mystical 
    states.&quot;<br>

    directions you can choose.”<br>

    &quot;When you are saying that you are happy and you are not, there will be a

    &quot;Your body is the ground and metaphor of your life, the expression of your 
    existence. It is your Bible, your encyclopedia, your life story. Everything

    “Even the most daring and accomplished people have undergone tremendous 
    difficulty. In fact, the more successful they became, the more they 
    attributed their success to the lessons learned during their most difficult 
    times. Adversity is our teacher. When we view adversity as a guide towards 
    greater inner growth, we will then learn to accept the wisdom our soul came 
    into this life to learn.”<br>
    - Barbara Rose<br>
    <br>
    “No matter what difficulty you are facing, it is coming from Divine Light to 
    bring you to a higher place within. Write down every conceivable reason that 
    this situation can contribute towards your growth. Write down every way this 
    experience can possibly set the stage for serving to uplift others. When you 
    are complete, and have come to the other side of this experience, you will 
    then know 'why' it happened.”<br>

    &quot;If a man devotes himself to the instructions of his own unconscious, it can 
    bestow this gift [of renewal], so that suddenly life, which has been stale

    possibilities.&quot;<br>
    - Marie-Louise von Franz<br>
    <br>
    “If you're having difficulty coming up with new ideas, then slow down. For 
    me, slowing down has been a tremendous source of creativity. It has allowed 
    me to open up - to know that there's life under the earth and that I have to 
    let it come through me in a new way. Creativity exists in the present 
    moment. You can't find it anywhere else.”<br>

    <br>
    &quot;Letting go of our suffering is the hardest work we will ever do. It is also

    ?&quot;Be tolerant and defend the right to be different. Never use the faculty of

    “It's important to be heroic, ambitious, productive, efficient, creative, 
    and progressive, but these qualities don't necessarily nurture soul. The 
    soul has different concerns, of equal value: downtime for reflection, 
    conversation, and reverie; beauty that is captivating and pleasuring; 
    relatedness to the environs and to people; and any animal’s rhythm of rest 
    and activity.”<br>

    &quot;Remember, most of the things you think you need are ego trips designed to 
    bolster your image and your perception of security.... You'll waste a lot of 
    energy satisfying your ego only to find that, as soon as it's got what it 
    wants, it ignores all your efforts and promptly nails another list of 
    demands to your forehead. The ego will always try to force you to slave for 
    its vision. I wouldn't stand for that BS if I were you.&quot;<br>

    <br>
    &quot;We have no need to teach pure motives to the mind. All that is necessary to

    ?&quot;There is a power that manifests itself through spiritual association. 
    Jesus said that where many were gathered in His name, in the name of the

    &quot;One of the great dangers of transformational work is that the ego attempts

    &quot;To try is to risk failure. But risk must be taken because the greatest

    &quot;We live in a world of theophanies. Holiness comes wrapped in the ordinary.

    &quot;Life is complex. Each one of us must make his own path through life. There 
    are no self-help manuals, no formulas, no easy answers. The right road for

    - M. Scott Peck<br>
    <br>
    &quot;What every man needs, regardless of his job or the kind of work he is

    thing to do. What this is no one can tell him. It must be his own creation.&quot;<br>

    &quot;Activity is not achievement. It is not enough to rush about beginning a lot

    &quot;When coasting in our comfort zones, we don't grow. We continue to do more 
    of the same.... Maintaining a comfort zone can, paradoxically, lead to 
    discomfort in the long run. If by being comfortable we avoid important life 
    issues, internal tension accumulates.... Eventually, as both internal and 
    external pressures for change persist, the ‘comfort zone’ ceases to serve 
    us.&quot;<br>

    &quot;People spend too much time finding other people to blame, too much energy

    &quot;There is a thought in your mind right now. The longer you hold on to it, 
    the more you dwell upon it, the more life you give to that thought. Give it 
    enough life, and it will become real. So make sure the thought is indeed a 
    great one.&quot;<br>
    - Ralph Marston<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Man is made or unmade by himself. In the armory of thought he forges the 
    weapons by which he destroys himself. He also fashions the tools with which 
    he builds for himself heavenly mansions of joy and strength and peace.&quot;<br>
    - James Allen<br>
    <br>
    &quot;You watch your mind to see who you are not. I watch my mind to gain a sense 
    of its content, which has always been my pain. As I watch it, I get a sense 
    of its impermanence. Thoughts come and go as part of a process. I see how 
    content dissolves into process and begin to see the patterns in the process. 
    Realizing it isn’t MY suffering, MY pain, it becomes THE pain. I’ve gone 
    from the tiny, the small, and the individual to the universal. I feel OUR 
    pain. When we do, we go from fear to compassion. Fear is MY pain, compassion 
    is THE pain.&quot;<br>
    - Stephen Levine<br>

    &quot;Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. You can see 
    that when you think how the friends that really listen to us are the ones we 
    move toward, and we want to sit in their radius as though it did us good, 
    like ultraviolet rays.&quot;<br>
    - Brenda Ueland<br>
    <br>
    &quot;So when you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you 
    are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is 
    being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.&quot;<br>

    alone.&quot;<br>
    - Blaise Pascal<br>
    <br>
    &quot;When mystics use the word love, they use it very carefully - in the deeply 
    spiritual sense, where to love is to know; to love is to act. If you really 
    love, from the depths of your Consciousness, that love gives you a native 
    wisdom. You perceive the needs of others intuitively and clearly, with 
    detachment from any personal desires; and you know how to act creatively to 
    meet those needs, dexterously surmounting any obstacle that comes in the 
    way. Such is the immense, driving power of love.&quot;<br>
    - Eknath Easwaran<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Therefore, when I say that ‘I love,’ it is not I who love, but in reality 
    Love who acts through me. Love is not so much something I do as something 
    that I am. Love is not a doing but a state of being - a relatedness, a 
    connectedness to another mortal, an identification with her or him that 
    simply flows within me and through me, independent of my intentions or my 
    efforts.&quot;<br>
    - Robert A. Johnson<br>
    <br>
    &quot;When you are aware that you are the force that is Life, anything is 
    possible. Miracles happen all the time, because those miracles are performed 
    by the heart. The heart is in direct communion with the human soul, and when 
    the heart speaks, even with the resistance of the head, something inside you 
    changes; your heart opens another heart, and true love is possible.&quot;<br>

    <br>
    &quot;A human being is a part of the whole, called by us ‘Universe,’ a part 
    limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings 
    as something separated from the rest - a kind of optical delusion of his 
    consciousness. This delusion is akind of prison for us, restricting us to 
    our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our 
    task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of 
    compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its 
    beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such 
    achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner 
    security.&quot;<br>
    - Albert Einstein<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Higher consciousness, enLIGHTenment, comes from meaningful experiences and 
    lessons passed with the understanding that there truly is only one law - the

    known.&quot;<br>

    &quot;All major mystical traditions have recognized that there is a paradox at 
    the heart of the journey of return to Origin. ...Put simply, this is that we 
    are already what we seek, and that what we are looking for on the Path with 
    such an intensity of striving and passion and discipline is already within 
    and around us at all moments. The journey and all its different ordeals are 
    all emanations of the One Spirit that is manifesting everything in all 
    dimensions; every rung of the ladder we climb toward final awareness is made 
    of the divine stuff of awareness itself; Divine Consciousness is at once 
    creating and manifesting all things and acting in and as all things in 
    various states of self-disguise throughout all the different levels and 
    dimensions of the universe.&quot;<br>

    discord.&quot;<br>

    &quot;Generally, appreciation means some blend of thankfulness, admiration, 
    approval, and gratitude. In the financial world, something that 
    ‘appreciates’ grows in value. With the power tool of appreciation, you get 
    the benefit of both perspectives: as you learn to be consistently thankful 
    and approving, your life will grow in value.&quot;<br>

    <br>
    &quot;Mindfulness means moment-to-moment, non-judgmental awareness. It is 
    cultivated by refining our capacity to pay attention, intentionally, in the 
    present moment, and then sustaining that attention over time as best we can. 
    In the process, we become more in touch with our life as it is unfolding.&quot;<br>

    &quot;For a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin - real

    be paid. Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles 
    were my life.&quot;<br>

    In a buy-now, consume-now culture like ours, it takes courage to make the 
    decisions today that may make us rich tomorrow. It takes courage to face up 
    to the facts of old age and mortality and to prepare for them. It also takes 
    courage to live generously, regardless of your financial state of affairs. 
    ...It takes courage to ask for what you want. And it takes courage to live 
    honestly, wisely, true to yourself ...and true to your desire for more.&quot;<br>

    The anxious student asked the Zen master how long to enlightenment. The Zen 
    Master answered a long time, at least 10 years. The student said, &quot;Well I 
    will work twice as hard.&quot; The Zen master said, &quot;Then it will take 20 years.&quot; 
    &quot;No!&quot; said the committed student, &quot;I will work three times as hard.&quot; &quot;Well

    &quot;People ask what must they become to be loving. The answer is ‘nothing.’ It

    &quot;To know how to choose a path with heart is to learn how to follow intuitive

    <br>
    &quot;When you have compassion and surrender to your own heart, you are 
    surrendering to the hidden power in your heart, God. You are surrendering to 
    love, because God is Love, the cohesive force of the universe that connects 
    us all. Surrender is not just a religious concept; it's a power tool for 
    listening to the voice of your spirit and following its directions. When you 
    surrender your head to your heart, you allow your heart to give you a wider, 
    higher intelligence perspective. Remember the phrase, ‘The real teacher is 
    within you.’ Very simply, that teacher is to be found in the common sense of 
    your own heart.&quot;<br>

    God has a wise and loving purpose in leaving us behind. There is work to be

    others—if only to love and to pray. Our presence may also be for the purpose

    As we evolve, we handle knowledge in different ways. We tend to move through

    <br>

    - We comprehend meaning from the facts.<br>

    &quot;We don't always know what makes us happy. We know, instead, what we think 
    SHOULD. We are baffled and confused when our attempts at happiness fail...We 
    are mute when it comes to naming accurately our own preferences, delights, 
    gifts, talents. The voice of our original self is often muffled, 
    overwhelmed, even strangled, by the voices of other people's expectations. 
    The tongue of the original self is the language of the heart.&quot;<br>
    - Julia Cameron<br>
    <br>
    We are each unique beings with a unique path in life. If we wish to be 
    fulfilled, we need to go to our own hearts for direction. We might regularly 
    ask ourselves:<br>
    <br>
    - &quot;What do I really want to do?&quot;<br>
    <br>
    - &quot;What brings me greatest happiness?&quot;<br>
    <br>

    &quot;If we fail to nourish our souls, they wither, and without soul, life ceases 
    to have meaning.... The creative process shrivels in the absence of

    living.&quot;<br>
    - Marion Woodman<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I learned... that inspiration does not come like a bolt, nor is it kinetic, 
    energetic, striving, but it comes to us slowly and quietly and all the time,

    flowing, prime it with a little solitude and idleness.&quot;<br>

    <br>
    ?&quot;When we come into contact with the other person, our thoughts and actions 
    should express our mind of compassion, even if that person says and does 
    things that are not easy to accept. We practice in this way until we see 
    clearly that our love is not contingent upon the other person being 
    lovable.&quot; -Thich Nhat Hanh<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I think that whenever soul is present, it’s because what you’re doing, whom 
    you’re with, where you are, evokes love without your thinking about it. You 
    are totally absorbed in the place or person or event, without ego and 
    without judgment.&quot;<br>

    &quot;This moment is the moment of reality, of union, of truth. Nothing needs to

    &quot;The soul requires duration of time - rich, thick, deep, velvety time - and 
    it thrives on rhythm. Soul can’t be hurried or harried .... We may go

    not had the opportunity to feel them from many different points of view.&quot;<br>

    &quot;All major mystical traditions have recognized that there is a paradox at 
    the heart of the journey of return to Origin. ...Put simply, this is that we 
    are already what we seek, and that what we are looking for on the Path with 
    such an intensity of striving and passion and discipline is already within 
    and around us at all moments. The journey and all its different ordeals are 
    all emanations of the One Spirit that is manifesting everything in all 
    dimensions; every rung of the ladder we climb toward final awareness is made 
    of the divine stuff of awareness itself; Divine Consciousness is at once 
    creating and manifesting all things and acting in and as all things in 
    various states of self-disguise throughout all the different levels and 
    dimensions of the universe.&quot;<br>
    - Andrew Harvey<br>
    <br>
    &quot;When you are able to contain both the light and dark together, that is a 
    very enlightening state. It means that you no longer have to choose one 
    experience over another. You do not have to choose love OR hate, blame OR 
    forgiveness, sadness OR joy, anger OR openheartedness. You are no longer 
    polarized; no particular feeling boxes you in and keeps you from the light 
    of true self. You then have access to the full range of human experiences 
    you came into this life to embrace.&quot;<br>

    boxing, walking, playing, dancing and grace before I dip the pen in the ink.

    The 4 D's of spiritual growth<br>
    <br>
    “Promise Yourself ... to be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of 
    mind. ...To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for 
    fear, and too happy to permit the presence of trouble.”<br>
    - Drawn from the Optimist Creed of the Optimist International Club<br>
    <br>
    Reflect on this pathway for meaningful growth:<br>
    <br>
    DISCIPLINE - To create change in our lives, we need to consistently focus on 
    what we want.<br>
    <br>
    DETACHMENT - Practice the art of detached observation. Let go of automatic 
    defenses and patterns.<br>
    <br>
    DISCERNMENT - Seek to discern the lower from the higher. What is 
    self-serving and what is soul-inspired? Discernment carries no judgment. 
    There are no goods and bads. Remain as a detached witness.<br>
    <br>
    DHARMA - This is an East Indian word meaning &quot;living your unique purpose.&quot; 
    How do you find meaning and fulfillment in ways that are natural to you? How 
    do you best serve and contribute to the world?<br>
    <br>
    &quot;If you wish to travel far and fast, travel light. Take off all your envies, 
    jealousies, unforgiveness, selfishness, and fears.&quot;<br>

    &quot;To know how to choose a path with heart is to learn how to follow intuitive

    - Jean Shinoda Bolen <br>
    <br>
    &quot;When you have compassion and surrender to your own heart, you are 
    surrendering to the hidden power in your heart, God. You are surrendering to 
    love, because God is Love, the cohesive force of the universe that connects 
    us all. Surrender is not just a religious concept; it's a power tool for 
    listening to the voice of your spirit and following its directions. When you 
    surrender your head to your heart, you allow your heart to give you a wider, 
    higher intelligence perspective. Remember the phrase, ‘The real teacher is 
    within you.’ Very simply, that teacher is to be found in the common sense of 
    your own heart.&quot;<br>

    “Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we 
    are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most 
    frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, 
    talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. 
    Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened 
    about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are 
    all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory 
    of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And 
    as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission 
    to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence 
    automatically liberates others.&quot;<br>

    &quot;Do not turn and run, for there is nowhere worthwhile for you to go. Do not

    We are each unique, so comparing ourselves to others serves no purpose. Even

    Typically, comparison just brings the ego a false sense of either

    The nature of the Bodhisattva is apparent from a teaching story in which 
    three people are walking through a desert. Parched and thirsty, they spy a 
    high wall ahead. They approach and circumnavigate it, but it has no entrance 
    or doorway.<br>
    One climbs upon the shoulders of the others, looks inside, yells ?Eureka? 
    and jumps inside. The second then climbs up and repeats the actions of the 
    first. <br>
    The third laboriously climbs the wall without assistance and sees a lush 
    garden inside the wall. It has cooling water, trees, fruit, etc. But, 
    instead of jumping into the garden, <br>
    the third person jumps back out into the desert and seeks out desert 
    wanderers to tell them about the garden and how to find it. The third person 
    is the Bodhisattva.<br>
    <br>
    Similarly, the West has the story of the seeker who approached a master 
    asking for teachings. The master inquired if the student was indifferent to 
    praise and ridicule. <br>
    When the student admitted he/she was not so indifferent, the master directed 
    him/her to go back out into the world and develop this ability. <br>
    Only afterwards would the master accept the student for further training.<br>

    The metaphor of the moon's reflection in the mountain lake epitomizes the 
    Buddhist Middle Way view. <br>
    The reflection does exist (thus, Nihilism is avoided) as a relative truth, 
    but it is not actually the moon (not ultimate truth and not Eternal). <br>
    Another metaphor has resulted in a specific Dzogchen exercise, the Sky 
    Exercise, in which one gazes at the sky, an analogy of the ground of being.
    <br>
    Like the reflection, the sky has no ultimate existence, yet it is there. The 
    clouds, like one's thoughts, drift by and disappear, and the sun (like the 
    ground of being or Tara) radiates equally to everything and everyone.<br>

    It is how we “see”: “We use the same areas for vision as for our visual 
    imagination. Scientists studying vision have known for long time that the 
    visual system is far more than a <br>
    one-way street from retina to cortex. We now know that for every connection 
    in carrying information from the eyes, there are and least ten coming in 
    exactly the opposite direction from the higher areas of the brain. <br>
    It seems that information leaving our retina is not complete enough to 
    create a full and rich interpretation of the world. Our imagination, then, 
    allows us to fill in the gaps and convert the distorted image from the eyes
    <br>
    into the complete and vibrant world that we see.”“ Similar complexities 
    exist for all the separate body physiologies.<br>

    <font face="Arial">Many years ago in a small Indian village, a farmer had the misfortune Of 
    owing a large sum of money to a village Moneylender.<br>
    The Moneylender , who was old and ugly, fancied the farmer's beautiful 
    Daughter. So he proposed a bargain.<br>
    He said he would forgo the farmer's debt if he could marry his Daughter. 
    Both the farmer and his daughter were horrified by the Proposal.<br>
    So the cunning money-lender suggested that they let Providence decide the 
    matter.<br>
    He told them that he would put a black Pebble and a white pebble into an 
    empty money bag. Then the girl would Have to pick one pebble from the bag.<br>
    1) If she picked the black pebble, she would become his wife and her 
    father's debt would be forgiven.<br>
    2) If she picked the white pebble she need not marry him and her father's 
    debt would still be forgiven.<br>
    3) But if she refused to pick a pebble, her father would be thrown into 
    Jail.<br>
    They were standing on a pebble strewn path in the farmer's field. As They 
    talked, the moneylender bent over to pick up two pebbles. As he Picked them 
    up, the sharp-eyed girl noticed that he had picked up two Black pebbles and 
    put them into the bag.<br>
    He then asked the girl to pick A pebble from the bag.<br>
    Now, imagine that you were standing in the field. What would you have Done 
    if you were the girl? If you had to advise her, what would you Have told 
    her?<br>
    Careful analysis would produce three possibilities:<br>
    1. The girl should refuse to take a pebble.<br>
    2. The girl should show that there were two black pebbles in the bag And 
    expose the money-lender as a cheat.<br>
    3. The girl should pick a black pebble and sacrifice herself in order To 
    save her father from his debt and imprisonment.<br>
    Take a moment to ponder over the story. The above story is used with The 
    hope that it will make us appreciate the difference between lateral And 
    logical thinking.<br>
    The girl's dilemma cannot be solved with Traditional logical thinking. Think 
    of the consequences if she chooses<br>
    The above logical answers.<br>
    What would you recommend to the Girl to do?<br>
    Well, here is what she did ....<br>
    The girl put her hand into the moneybag and drew out a pebble. Without 
    Looking at it, she fumbled and let it fall onto the pebble-strewn path Where 
    it immediately became lost among all the other pebbles.<br>
    &quot;Oh, how clumsy of me,&quot; she said. &quot;But never mind, if you look into the Bag 
    for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I Picked.&quot;<br>
    Since the remaining pebble is black, it must be assumed that she had Picked 
    the white one. And since the money-lender dared not admit his Dishonesty, 
    the girl changed what seemed an impossible situation into An extremely 
    advantageous one.<br>
    <br>
    MORAL OF THE STORY:<br>

    to find them .</font></p>

    <font size="2"><i>Energetic Sweeping</i></font> <font size="2">In some of 
    our lives, sweeping has become an activity performed without much thought. 
    In many cases, sweeping is a lost art, replaced by the noisy, efficient 
    vacuum cleaner. But in several cultures and religions, sweeping the front 
    and back porch every morning is regarded as an important cleansing ritual 
    that prepares the ground for new energy on every level—physically, 
    spiritually, emotionally, and mentally. It is often employed to sanctify a 
    space and prepare it for a ceremony. This seemingly simple action has the 
    power to clear away the old and make space for the new. It stirs up the 
    energy in a place, clearing out the astral buildup that is the natural 
    by-product of the presence of humans. <br>
    <br>
    This kind of sweeping is not about cleaning the area of dust. In fact, the 
    broom doesn’t have to actually touch the ground to be effective. You might 
    want to consider having two different brooms, one you use for cleaning dust 
    and dirt, and one you use for energy clearing. If you are so inspired, you 
    could decorate your broom by carving its handle, painting it, decorating it 
    with gemstones and ribbons, or any other creative adornment that appeals to 
    you. You can also make your own broom out of tree branches and twigs, or 
    choose a naturally appearing broom from nature, such as a pine bough. <br>
    <br>
    Sweeping each morning prepares the ground for the new day at the same time 
    as it deepens our awareness of the importance of letting go of the past to 
    welcome the present. As we clear the energy of our space, we clear our own 
    energy systems. In addition, we create a space that feels clean, clear, and 
    open to all who enter. Be sure to think welcoming thoughts as you sweep, 
    manifesting what you need for the day. Making sweeping part of our daily 
    ritual tunes us into the continuing cycle of releasing the old and welcoming 
    the new that is the hallmark of a healthy energy system. </font></font></p>

    injury that left him paralyzed, without the use of his legs. <br>
    <br>
    1. You can't know what will happen tomorrow, and its better that way. <br>
    2. You can't control what happens, just how you respond.<br>
    3. Loss amplifies the value of what remains.<br>
    4. It's easier to create new dreams than to cling to broken ones.<br>
    5. Your happiness is more important than righting injustices.<br>
    <br>
    As Mangurian concluded: &quot;Many of us underestimate our ability to withstand<br>
    crisis. I certainly did. If you had asked me before my injury how I would<br>
    handle being paralyzed, I would have said ...&quot;You might as well put me in a<br>
    corner and shoot me.&quot; <br>
    &quot;My new life's a work in progress, and I have to re-create parts of myself<br>
    every day. &quot;<br>
    &quot;In my new life, I am able to use all of my assets, including my paralysis,<br>

    attention to and which ones to ignore or dismiss. Even if we manage to move 
    forward amidst the confusion, doubts and concerns may linger in our psyches 
    simply because they have not been fully expressed and examined. As a result, 
    we may have trouble being at peace with the decisions we do make. <br>
    <br>
    One way to handle this dilemma is to consciously make time for a meeting of 
    the minds within our psyche. This can be done as a guided meditation or as a 
    journaling exercise. In both we can summon the many fragments that make up 
    the whole of who we are and give them each a chance to speak. This can be a 
    helpful tool in the face of a decision we need to make, and it can also be a 
    fruitful path to take in the interest of self-exploration and self-care. 
    When we gather the many fragments of our psyche together, the health and 
    power of the whole is greatly increased. <br>
    <br>
    We can imagine a roundtable in which we gather all the various 
    representatives of our being, allowing them to name themselves and giving 
    them a chance to speak. We allow each one to weigh in, fully expressing the 
    perspective they represent, and we listen without comment. As we listen, we 
    may be amazed at the wisdom and energy stored in these fragments of our 
    self. This gathering brings the fragmented pieces of our psyche into a 
    closer relationship, enabling us to move forward as a unified whole. </font>

    <span style="font-family: Arial; color: black"><font size="2">&quot;To try 
    is to risk failure. But risk must be taken because the greatest hazard of 
    life is to risk nothing. The person who risks nothing does nothing, has 
    nothing, is nothing. He may avoid suffering and sorrow, but he simply cannot 
    learn, feel, change, grow, live, and love.&quot;</font></span></p>

    risk is an essential step to self empowerment. This is the key to breaking 
    out of stuck thinking and behaviour. It is about breaking through the 
    comfort zones and barriers. It is about experiencing new levels of mind and 
    feelings. It is about experiencing more life. </font> </span></p>

    <span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;">We are each born into this 
    world with unique gifts. Within us is a glimmer of the divine, a light that 
    can potentially make the world a more beautiful place. But in many, that 
    light lies dormant, snuffed out by fears and feelings of inadequacy. To 
    spark it is to attract attention, face the possibility of rejection or the 
    responsibility of success, and risk being labeled immodest. Yet when we 
    undermine the light by hiding our aptitudes and quashing our dreams, we deny 
    ourselves and others a wealth of experiences. Your abilities are a part of 
    who you are and when you take pride in them, you affirm the love, esteem, 
    and trust with which you view yourself. Moreover, as you express the light 
    within, you grant others permission to do the same, freeing them to explore 
    their own talents. </span></tt>

    <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;; color: black;">
    <tt style="font-family: Arial;">For some, we are taught to hide our 
    light from the world since childhood. Relatives caution us that the 
    professions associated with our aptitudes are unattainable. Our peers may be 
    envious of our skills and thus overly critical of the activities we 
    instinctively enjoy. And authority figures admonish us to be humble and 
    avoid showing off. But there is a vast chasm that separates those who let 
    their light shine and those who seek only to draw attention to themselves. 
    When you dare to share your light with the world, the beauty and perfection 
    of your soul become clearly visible. You become a whole being-the literal 
    embodiment of your vast potential. Whether you are a wonderful dancer, a 
    first-rate cook, quick with numbers, or a natural negotiator, you'll come to 
    understand that you do the world no favors when you hold yourself back. </tt>

    <tt style="font-family: Arial;">If you have hidden your light for so 
    long that it has shrunk to an ember, make a list of everything you do well, 
    however impractical, silly, or seemingly inconsequential. Then ask yourself 
    how you can positively utilize those abilities in your daily life. The gifts 
    you were born with were not granted to you arbitrarily. While you may never 
    discover what impact your light has had on others, you can be certain that 
    when you embrace your talents and share them with others, you will spread 
    illumination in the world.</tt></span></p>

    internal tension accumulates.... Eventually, as both internal and external 
    pressures for change persist, the ‘comfort zone’ ceases to serve us.&quot;</font></span></p>
